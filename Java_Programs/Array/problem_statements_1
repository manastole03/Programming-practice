1.
Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in an array and print them on screen.

2.
Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Again ask user to give a number. Now, tell user whether that number is present in array or not.
3.
Take 20 integer inputs from user and print the following:
number of positive numbers
number of negative numbers
number of odd numbers
number of even numbers
number of 0s.
4.
Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Now, copy all the elements in an another array but in reverse order.
5.
Write a program to find the sum and product of all elements of an array.
6.
Initialize and print all elements of a 2D array.
7.
Find largest and smallest elements of an array.
8.
Write a program to check if elements of an array are same or not it read from front or back. E.g.-
9.
Take an array of 10 elements. Split it into middle and store the elements in two dfferent arrays. E.g.-
INITIAL array :
58	24	13	15	63	9	8	81	1	78

After spliting :
58	24	13	15	63
9	8	81	1	78
10.
Consider an integer array, the number of elements in which is determined by the user. The elements are also taken as input from the user. Write a program to find those pair of elements that has the maximum and minimum difference among all element pairs.

11.
If the input array is [10, 12, 20, 30, 25, 40, 32, 31, 35, 50, 60], your program should be able to find that the subarray lies between the indexes 3 and 8
